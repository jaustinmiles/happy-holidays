    <ol style="margin-left: 8%; margin-right: 8%">
        <li>Text characters are rendered on the screen by typing on the keyboard. All characters are permitted, but some of the special characters will have weird attachments to the strings. When a letter is rendered, a simple bell sound is played. The audio library of choice is Threejs's audio framework. All audio usages are based on example code from Threejs's documentation, and the sound files are retrieved from Freesound.org</li>
        <li>Letters are horizontally spaced between a margin on the left and right, which is the size of a letter. The spacing in between letters is based on the number of letters (decreases as more letters are added). It also resizes on all window changes.</li>
        <li>The letters are positioned between 1/4 and 3/4 of the screen. This is determined by methods visibleHeightAtDepthZ(), which determines based on the perspective of the camera that maximum height and object can be while still visible. This is used to calculate the range of positions.</li>
        <li>The strings are drawn from a pivot object that rests on the visible height at depth z of all the letters. The strings are children of the pivots, and the letters are children of the strings</li>
        <li>Text is received through the keyboard event handler, and input is checked for whether it is a backspace (in which case a letter is deleted), or any key that is not a single character representation (in which case it is disregarded). If it passes this check, it is rendered through TextGeometry from Threejs</li>
        <li>The selection method of choice is from Threejs's guide on GPU picking. This involves the rendering of two scenes, a simple one for picking and the more complex one that is shown. Only the objects that can be selected are rendered in the pickingScene. The sound played is jingling bells, also played through Threejs's audio framework.</li>
        <li>When a letter is selected, the picking point is stored. The picking point is then transformed to world coordinates through camera's unproject method from Threejs. This vector is then extended to the proper z depth and the world coordinates of the object chosen are then used to calculate how far from the center the user clicked. The number of spins and spin rate are then chosen based on this distance. The letters slow down linearly over time until they reach their stopping position</li>
        <li>The background image is a sprite, and is scaled with the resize of the window. The aspect ratio is also recalculated on resize, so the spacing and appearance of all the elements are handled simply in this single method.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4 style="text-align: center">Bonus Points</h4>
    <ol style="margin-left: 8%; margin-right: 8%">
        <li>The letters swing with pendulum physics. A pendulum interface is added, and the angular momentum and acceleration are adjusted at every timestep based on pendulum motion equations. The angle is drawn from the pivot point, which every string is attached to. The pendulums all start at random angles between -pi/6 and pi/6, and are allowed to swing freely from there according to the physics simulation</li>
        <li>Snowflakes are rendered as 3d models. The snowflake model used was taken from free3d.com, and is loaded using Threejs's OBJLoader object. This model is then copied several times and added to the scene. The randomness is acheived by alternating at rare intervals (on average, every 95 frames) between sine and cosine functions. There is also random noise added to the movements of the snowflakes at every time step. When the snowflake hits the bottom of the screen, it is reused and repositioned at the time to prevent wasted computations or memory usage. </li>
        <li>There is a background sprite that is positioned on the z axis far enough away that it is behind everything. However, the visible height and width of the image are computed at a nearer plane, so that it is larger than the screen. The mouse position is tracked through canvas's onmousemove function, and the center of the sprite is adjusted according to a small percentage proportional to the total width and height of the canvas element itself. </li>
        <li>The letters are animated coming into the scene by extending downward from the pivot point over time. The animation data for all the objects is tracked through individual interfaces for each animated object. When an object is removed, its entrance animation is canceled (if it's active), and the exit animation is started. The exit animation ends when the letter is no longer visible (it is moved to the right at a constant speed until it is off screen), and then the letter is removed from the scene and the object data is disposed of.</li>
